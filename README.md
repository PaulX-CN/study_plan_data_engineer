# study_plan_data_engineer

首先我是自学转行的数据工程师，其次在美国，和国内情况可能不太一样，所以给个大概的思路吧。



前言：

  个人不懂网络安全方向，但感觉这一块大都是运维的部门做的（？我不确定，勿喷），这里就不献丑了。大数据方向也主要分data scientist 数据分析和 data platform 数据平台两大块。大数据分析在大公司其实还是围绕sql （加上hive上或者sparksql上操作），高端点的用神经网络，但是量级也不会太大。



先贴个比较常见的数据工程师的jd吧：



What you’ll do
Build large-scale batch and real-time data pipelines with data processing frameworks like Scalding, Scio, Storm, Spark and the Google Cloud Platform.
Leverage best practices in continuous integration and delivery.
Help drive optimization, testing and tooling to improve data quality.
Collaborate with other engineers, ML experts and stakeholders, taking learning and leadership opportunities that will arise every single day.
Work in cross functional agile teams to continuously experiment, iterate and deliver on new product objectives.

Who you are
You know how to work with high volume heterogeneous data, preferably with distributed systems such as Hadoop, BigTable, and Cassandra.
You are knowledgeable about data modeling, data access, and data storage techniques.
You care about agile software processes, data-driven development, reliability, and responsible experimentation.
You understand the value of collaboration within teams.
