# study_plan_data_engineer

首先我是自学转行的数据工程师，其次在美国，和国内情况可能不太一样，所以给个大概的思路吧。



## 前言：

  个人不懂网络安全方向，但感觉这一块大都是运维的部门做的（？我不确定，勿喷），这里就不献丑了。大数据方向也主要分data scientist 数据分析和 data platform 数据平台两大块。大数据分析在大公司其实还是围绕sql （加上hive上或者sparksql上操作），高端点的用神经网络，但是量级也不会太大。
对于大数据工程师来说，最主要的应该是


**What you’ll do**

- Build large-scale batch and real-time data pipelines with data processing frameworks like Scalding, Scio, Storm, Spark and the Google Cloud Platform. 
- Leverage best practices in continuous integration and delivery.
- Help drive optimization, testing and tooling to improve data quality.
- Collaborate with other engineers, ML experts and stakeholders, taking learning and leadership opportunities that will arise every single day.
- Work in cross functional agile teams to continuously experiment, iterate and deliver on new product objectives.

· Contributing at a senior-level to the data warehouse design and data preparation by implementing a solid, robust, extensible design that supports key business flows.
· Performing all of the necessary data transformations to populate data into a warehouse table structure that is optimized for reporting.
· Establishing efficient design and programming patterns for engineers as well as for non-technical peoples.
· Designing, integrating and documenting technical components for seamless data extraction and analysis on big data platform.
· Ensuring best practices that can be adopted in Big Data stack and share across teams and BUs.
· Providing operational excellence through root cause analysis and continuous improvement for Big Data technologies and processes and contributes back to open source community.

先贴个比较常见的数据工程师的jd吧：

**Who you are**

- You know how to work with high volume heterogeneous data, preferably with distributed systems such as Hadoop, BigTable, and Cassandra. 
- You are knowledgeable about data modeling, data access, and data storage techniques.
- You care about agile software processes, data-driven development, reliability, and responsible experimentation.
- Experience with at least one scripting language (Shell, Python, Perl etc.)
- Experience with an OO programming language like Java.

**Preferred Qualifications**
- Experience working extensively in multi-petabyte DW environment
- Experience in engineering large-scale systems in a product environment
- Ability to write, analyze, and debug SQL queries
- Experience with Data Warehouse design, ETL (Extraction, Transformation & Load), architecting efficient software designs for DW platform.
- Knowledge of database modeling and design in a Data warehousing context
- Knowledge of NoSQL stores is a plus
- Experienced in implementing data warehouses with MPP databases like Teradata. [is a plus]
- Ideal candidates will have a deep understanding of technical and functional designs for Databases, Data Warehousing, Reporting, and Data Mining areas
- Passion for about continuous learning, experimenting, applying and contributing towards cutting edge open source Big Data technologies and software paradigms
